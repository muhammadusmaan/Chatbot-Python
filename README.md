# Chatbot using Conditional Probabilities - Python

This Python script introduces a chatbot leveraging conditional probabilities for category identification and sentiment analysis. Users can input comments related to predefined product categories like 'laptop,' 'mobile,' and specific tuple categories such as 'do' and 'buy.'

The script calculates conditional probabilities to assess the likelihood of each mentioned category and performs sentiment analysis to understand user intent. It dynamically responds by opening and reading specific text files associated with identified categories. In cases of uncertainty, the chatbot suggests general assistance or offers discount packages.

Operating in a continuous loop, the chatbot engages users in an interactive and context-aware manner, remembering the last mentioned product category. To use, run the script, input comments, and experience dynamic responses based on conditional probabilities and sentiment analysis. The script is adaptable for further enhancements and contributions.
